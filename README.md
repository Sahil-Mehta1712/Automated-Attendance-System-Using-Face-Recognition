# Automated-Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition
This project uses FaceNet MTCNN to detect and recognize student faces from images (with or without masks/accessories) and marks attendance by matching them against a saved dataset of face embeddings. An Excel sheet is generated with names and present/absent status for each student.
